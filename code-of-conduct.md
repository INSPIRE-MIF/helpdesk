# Code of conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

The views expressed are purely those of the authors and may not in any circumstances be regarded as stating an official position of the European Commission.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies across the whole INSPIRE-MIF organisation. Should it be deemed necessary, this Code of Conduct might be further tailored for specific repositories.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Posts or images that violate any laws or regulations.
* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal, religious, ethnical, racial or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission

* Explicit advertising of products or services or posting/endorsing/promoting for own personal gain
* Posting your or other people's personal contact information (i.e. telephone numbers, addresses etc)
* Anything else deemed inappropriate by us.

## Responsibilities

* The INSPIRE team is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and is expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. The INSPIRE team has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

* All members of the community should report any violations to this Code of Conduct to the INSPIRE team. The INSPIRE team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## Disciplinary Measures

The INSPIRE team reserves the right to delete any postings who do not adhere to this Code of conduct. This includes postings that disrupt or interfere with our technical operations. The team reserves the right to ban, temporarily or permanently, any userâ€™s account. On the first violation of any of the provisions of this Code of conduct, the user is warned and in case of a second non compliance, the team reserves the right to ban the user from the whole INSPIRE-MIF organisation.
