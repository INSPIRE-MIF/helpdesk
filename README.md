## INSPIRE helpdesk 
This space is used for discussions and announcements on general INSPIRE topics. Before reporting a problem or asking a question here, please make sure that the problem or question is not relevant to (only) a specific INSPIRE component. If this is the case, please use the dedicated helpdesks for the [Validator](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk-validator "Validator"), [Geoportal](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk-geoportal "Geoportal") or [Registry](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk-registry "Registry").

Use the *Discussions tab* to [start a discussion or raise a question](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk/discussions/) for the helpdesk or the INSPIRE community related to a generic INSPIRE matter, or use the *issue tracker* to [report a generic problem](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=report-a-problem-or-bug.md&title= "report a generic problem") related to INSPIRE that the helpdesk team should solve or assign to the relevant people.

Be aware that the "New discussion" button is available only to logged users.
